# 🛠️ Data Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my data engineering portfolio! This repository showcases hands-on projects and learning exercises I've built while transitioning from an ETL Developer to a Data Engineer.

I’m focused on mastering modern data tools like **Azure Data Factory**, **SQL**, **Databricks**, and **cloud-based pipelines**, with each subfolder containing a documented project that reflects practical scenarios.

## 📌 Goals for This Repo

- Maintain real-world pipeline examples with full documentation
- Show before/after snapshots (e.g., raw → cleaned data)
- Track my learning progress in a structured and reviewable format

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me & Contact

I'm a data professional with over 6 years of experience in ETL development and Informatica administration. I'm currently upskilling into a Data Engineering role with a focus on:

- Azure Data Engineering tools (ADF, Synapse, Microsoft Fabric)
- SQL and query optimization
- Cloud pipelines and automation
- Python, REST APIs, and modern data workflows

I'm actively building out my GitHub portfolio to showcase real-world pipelines and hands-on learning projects.
