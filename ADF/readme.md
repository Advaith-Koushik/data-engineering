# 🧩 Azure Data Factory Projects

This folder contains hands-on pipeline projects built using **Azure Data Factory (ADF)**. These projects showcase a variety of real-world data integration scenarios, including batch ingestion, source-to-target mappings, and cloud-native orchestration.

Each project inside this folder is structured as:
- A dedicated subfolder (e.g., `PL_Cars_Blob_to_SQL`)
- Contains its own README, JSON configs, datasets, and screenshots
- Fully deployable with secure and masked linked services

---

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated

- Creating and managing ADF pipelines from scratch
- Working with Azure Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, and Linked Services
- Designing Copy Activities with tabular mapping and schema enforcement
- Using integration runtime, dataset configuration, and activity parameters
- Monitoring, debugging, and validating pipeline execution in ADF Studio

---

## 📂 Included Pipelines

Each subfolder in this directory includes:
- A real-world use case (e.g., CSV to SQL load)
- JSON pipeline and dataset definitions
- Visual pipeline diagrams and monitoring screenshots
- SQL schema used in the target sink (if applicable)

## 🧑‍💻 Professional Context

As someone actively transitioning into a Data Engineering role, I've built these pipelines to solidify my understanding of cloud-native data integration workflows. These ADF projects reflect the same rigor, documentation, and modular structure I would apply in a production environment.
